# Snap2Know Application Blueprint

## Overview

Snap2Know is a mission-critical mobile application for field operators working with industrial equipment. It provides instant, authoritative, manufacturer-approved information through photo-based equipment recognition or short, intent-based voice commands. The system prioritizes safety, correctness, and traceability.

## Core Functions

The application is built around four core functions:

1.  **Application of Equipment:** Provides instructions for correct and safe equipment usage.
2.  **Maintenance:** Supports preventive and scheduled maintenance activities.
3.  **Troubleshoot:** Assists operators in diagnosing and resolving faults.
4.  **Tracking of Equipment:** Maintains equipment context and operational history.
